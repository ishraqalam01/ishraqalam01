- Hi, I’m Ishraq!
- I’m interested in devloping programs that help people and make lives easier. I'm also interested in gaining experience in programming so that I can be a part of our evolving world of technology. I am currently taking the Harvard CS50x course and learning through the practice application questions. 
- I’m proficient in VB.net, C#, and BASIC Stamp and a little bit of HTML and CSS - currently enhancing my skills in Python, perfecting HTML, CSS, and practicing implementing JavaScript. Soon, I am planning to implement new frameworks like bootstrap, and React to further enhance my projects. 
- Pronouns: He/Him
- Fun fact: I love reading and coding in my free time! The challenge is worth it! I love STEM-related activities, taking on challenges, and trying something new!
